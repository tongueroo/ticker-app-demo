This is a demo app to help me answer some quetions.

SETUP:
$ ruby ticker_talker.rb # to start pushing data to port 9100
$ ruby ticker_listener.rb # to start processing data from port 9100

# At this point, ticker_lister.rb is using nanite to add messages to the exchange.  However, no nanite agents have been started.

$ cd ticker_agent
$ nanite -t ticker # start the nanite agent to process off the exchange.

QUESTION:
So when i call Nanite.request("/ticker/handle", data) to an agent
if there are zero agents running, it seems that those requests get lost
is that the way its supposed to work?  i thought that Nanite.request("/ticker/handle", data) will save the requests into a queue (the exchange) and whenever i fire up my nanite actors later, it will pick it up from the exchange, and not lose the requests...
