QUESTION:
so when i call Nanite.request("/ticker/handle", data) to an agent
if there are zero agents running, it seems that those requests get lost
is that the way its supposed to work?  i thought that Nanite.request("/ticker/handle", data) will save the requests into a queue (the exchange) and whenever i fire up my nanite actors later, it will pick it up from the exchange, and not lose the requests...
